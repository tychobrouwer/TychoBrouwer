# Hi Person,

Working on some random projects and some stuff for school. Like to believe I can write good code, working on that since the beginning of 2020.

- Learning languages as I go
    - Trying to work on some Python and Java
    - Done some HTML5, CSS3, SCSS, JAVASCRIPT, TYPESCRIPT, C++ (Arduino/ Raspberry) and PHP

## Current
- Nothing really :(
